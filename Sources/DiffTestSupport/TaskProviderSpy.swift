/// Tracking ``TaskProvider`` test double that lets a test await the real completion of spawned
/// tasks instead of polling.
///
/// Every spawned work task is tracked: the spy counts the spawn immediately and the completion
/// once the task finishes. Tests then await real boundaries:
/// ``waitForAllTasks(timeout:)`` suspends until every registered task (including tasks registered
/// while waiting) has finished, and ``waitForSpawnedTasks(atLeast:timeout:)`` suspends until a
/// task exists at all (for tests that must drive a task's input after it started). Both fail fast
/// with a `CountProbeTimeoutError` instead of hanging.
///
/// The counters are payload-free `CountProbe<Never>`s — one spawn/completion pair for work and
/// one for observations — so the spy keeps a running count without retaining a backing array.
///
/// It lives in `DiffTestSupport`, which only links into test targets, so it can conform to
/// ``TaskProvider`` directly with no `#if DEBUG` guard instead of needing a `@retroactive`
/// conformance shim in each test target.
///
/// ## Teardown
///
/// Work and observation handles are both retained so they can be cancelled deterministically:
/// ``cancelPendingWork()`` and ``cancelObservations()`` cancel each kind, and `deinit` calls
/// both as a safety net so a forgotten teardown cannot leak a suspended task onto the shared test
/// executor.
