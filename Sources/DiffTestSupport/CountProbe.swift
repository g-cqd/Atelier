/// Typed counter + collector that lets a test wait until a known event boundary has fired
/// `N` times, then introspect what was recorded.
///
/// `CountProbe` replaces ad-hoc counters and `Task.yield()` polling loops in tests. The
/// system-under-test (or a test double) calls ``record(_:)`` whenever an observable effect
/// happens; the test awaits that boundary with ``wait(forAtLeast:timeout:)`` and then asserts
/// on ``events`` / ``count`` / ``isEmpty``.
///
/// ## Canonical usage
///
/// Wire ``record(_:)`` to the SUT's observable effect, start the work, await the boundary,
/// then assert. No `withThrowingTaskGroup`, no manual timeout task, no `group.next()`
/// versus `group.waitForAll()` subtlety — the probe owns the deadline:
///
/// ```swift
/// let probe = CountProbe<Int>()
/// let producer = NumberStreamer(onEmit: { probe.record($0) })
///
/// producer.start(emitting: [1, 2, 3])   // fire-and-forget async work
/// try await probe.wait(forAtLeast: 3)   // suspends until the 3rd event — or the deadline
///
/// #expect(probe.events == [1, 2, 3])
/// ```
///
/// ## Count-only probes
///
/// When a test only cares *how many* times a boundary fired — not the payloads — construct a bare
/// `CountProbe()` and use the no-argument ``record()`` overload. With no generic argument the
/// payload type resolves to the uninhabited `Never` (see ``init(label:file:function:line:)``), so
/// no `<Never>` is spelled at the call site, the payload-taking ``record(_:)`` cannot be called
/// (there is no `Never` to pass), and ``events`` is provably always empty — count-only is a
/// type-level guarantee and the backing array never grows:
///
/// ```swift
/// let spawns = CountProbe()              // no generic argument; the payload resolves to Never
/// spawns.record()                        // the only way to record; `record(())` cannot compile
/// try await spawns.wait(forAtLeast: 1)
/// ```
///
/// ``wait(forAtLeast:timeout:)`` races the recorded-count boundary against `timeout`
/// (default 1s) internally, so a producer that never reaches the target fails *fast* with a
/// ``CountProbeTimeoutError`` pointing at the probe's creation site, instead of hanging or
/// blocking until an unrelated sibling task finishes.
///
/// ## Threading
///
/// State lives in a `Mutex<State>` (Synchronization, iOS 18+). The count and the event array are
/// updated under the same lock, so a waiter woken at count `N` always observes `N` recorded
/// events. Continuations are resumed *outside* the lock so a re-entrant resumer cannot deadlock,
/// and cancellation is checked *inside* the lock so a sleeper is never orphaned between
/// registration and the cancellation handler.
