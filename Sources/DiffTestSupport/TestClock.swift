/// Virtual `Clock` whose `sleep(for:)` only resumes when the test
/// calls ``advance(by:)``.
///
/// Inject into any production type whose `init` accepts
/// `clock: any Clock<Duration> = ContinuousClock()` so a
/// `Task.sleep(for:)`-style debounce becomes deterministic in tests:
/// instead of waiting `N` real milliseconds, the test rendezvouses
/// with the production-side `sleep` call via
/// ``waitForSleepers(count:)``, then calls ``advance(by:)`` to
/// release every sleeper whose deadline has elapsed.
///
/// ## Why an explicit rendezvous (no `Task.yield()`)
///
/// `sleep(for:)` computes its deadline as `clock.now + duration` at
/// the moment sleep is called. If the test calls `advance(by:)`
/// before the spawned Task has reached `sleep`, the clock moves but
/// no sleeper is queued — and when the Task finally calls `sleep`,
/// the new deadline lives in the future relative to the already-
/// advanced clock, so the sleeper waits forever.
///
/// `Task.yield()` before `advance` "fixes" this in practice but is
/// non-deterministic under load. ``waitForSleepers(count:)``
/// suspends on a `CheckedContinuation` resumed *only* when the
/// requested number of additional sleepers have been appended to
/// the queue — pure event-driven rendezvous through Swift
/// Concurrency, no yielding, no polling, no timeouts.
///
/// ## "N more" semantics
///
/// `waitForSleepers(count:)` waits for `count` ADDITIONAL sleepers
/// past whatever was queued at registration time. This matches the
/// human intent of every realistic call site: "wait for my new
/// spawned Task to register its sleeper", not "wait until the queue
/// has at least N entries total". The distinction only matters when
/// the test composes multiple awaits mid-flow — a queue-size
/// threshold would trip immediately if a previous gated sleeper is
/// still queued.
///
/// ## Cancellation
///
/// Both `sleep(until:tolerance:)` and `waitForSleepers(count:)` are
/// cancellation-aware via `withTaskCancellationHandler`. Cancelled
/// waiters / sleepers are removed from their queues and their
/// continuations resumed with `CancellationError`, surfacing the
/// cancellation at the actual call site (not via downstream
/// `Task.checkCancellation()` indirection).
///
/// ## Typical pattern
///
/// ```swift
/// let clock = TestClock()
/// let controller = UndoController(clock: clock)
/// let gate = TaskGate()
///
/// controller.scheduleCommit(delayMilliseconds: 50) { gate.open() }
/// try await clock.waitForSleepers()                // production reached sleep
/// await clock.advance(by: .milliseconds(50))       // drain sleeper
/// try await gate.wait()                            // production-opened signal
/// ```
