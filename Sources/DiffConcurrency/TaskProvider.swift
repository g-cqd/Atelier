// Vendored from https://github.com/aemi-studio/aemi (TaskProvider.swift).
/// Injection point for spawning unstructured tasks.
///
/// Production code creates fire-and-forget work through this protocol instead of calling
/// `Task.init` directly, so tests can substitute a tracking double and await the actual
/// completion of spawned work instead of polling.
///
/// The ``task(role:priority:operation:)`` signatures mirror `Task.init`: the `operation` closure
/// carries the same `@_inheritActorContext`, `@_implicitSelfCapture`, `sending`, and
/// `@isolated(any)` treatment, so a closure literal both inherits the caller's actor context and
/// may reference `self` implicitly, exactly like `Task { ... }`. Adopting the provider is
/// therefore a textual substitution of `Task {` with `taskProvider.task {`.
///
/// The ``detachedTask(role:priority:operation:)`` signatures mirror `Task.detached` instead.
/// Detachment cannot be expressed as a ``TaskRole`` case because a closure's isolation is fixed
/// at the call site by the parameter's declared attributes: `@_inheritActorContext` binds the
/// caller's actor context into the closure literal the moment it is formed, before any runtime
/// `role` value could be inspected. The detached family therefore drops `@_inheritActorContext`
/// (so a closure literal stays nonisolated and runs off the caller's actor) and
/// `@_implicitSelfCapture` (so a `self` capture must be spelled out, exactly as with
/// `Task.detached`).
///
/// `role:` and `priority:` are required on the protocol methods; convenience overloads default
/// them to `.work` / `nil`, so the common spellings stay `taskProvider.task { … }` and
/// `taskProvider.detachedTask { … }`.
